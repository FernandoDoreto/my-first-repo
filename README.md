## Mini App Example
* This example is to validate if Python packages from Data Practitioner Course 
(Streamlit, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Sklearn, Tensorflow etc) 
will run properly at **Gitpod** and at **Code Challenge System**

## App Strucutre
* User Story: Explains App Objective
* EDA: Pairplot, Heatmap, 3D plot - validates seaborn and plotly run at gitpod
* Sklearn: Decision Tree model - validates Sklearn runs at gitpod 
* Tensorflow': Sequential model - validates Tensorflow runs at gitpod


## Narrative 
* As a Data Analyst from Botanic Garden, you are requested by Special Flower division to develop a 
system capable to distinguish among 3 distinct Iris flowers. 
* We will create an App to inform what is the flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. 
It is a 3-class, single-label, classification model: 0 (Setosa ), 1 (Versicolour) and 2 (Virginica).
* Our ideal outcome is to help Special Flowers botanics to speed up their diagnosis during their next 
field mission at XYZ forest.
